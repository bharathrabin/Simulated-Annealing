# Simulated-Annealing
An Image Unscrambler that uses Simulated Annealing as the main method to unscramble images. 
Key points are to remember to define an energy function that assigns each element in the state space to a scalar value (energyCalculationdiff2.m)
And a method by which we traverse the state space (newmicrostate.m)
The main wrapper around these two files is SimulatedAnnealing.m
Please read the project report to get a better grasp of how the algorithm works
The results got are also given in the report and are part of the repo individually
